  "OneLineDescription": "Increases the difference between item tiers (Iron, Steel, etc.), so that item tier matters more.",
  "LongDescription": "In vanilla Skyrim the difference between low tier items (e.g. Iron) and high tier items (e.g. Daedric) is quite small. A Daedric Helmet has only 50% more armor than an Iron Helmet. As a result, perks, enchantments and tempering often has a bigger impact on damage/armor than the item tier itself. By increasing the difference between the item tiers, finding higher tier items becomes more rewarding.\r\n\r\nSide effect: Enemies with high tier items will also deal more (sometimes a lot more) damage.",
